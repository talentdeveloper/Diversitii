ABOUT

This program is designed to insert provided data into the Firebase database and storage associated
with the Diversitii Challenge app.

It will work with both CSV and JSON input files and can handle special characters, so
long as they are pasted into the CSV or JSON files provided in the "assets" folder.

It also includes a feature to check for potential data overwrites before completing an upload
operation (if, for example, an answer is marked with AnswerId 1 for TopicId 3 and an answer 1 for
topic 3 already exists in the database, the program will show an alert if set to do so).

On error conditions, messages will be displayed at the bottom of the device screen, and in the
Logcat logs.


CAVEATS:
-   If an upload operation is canceled, no updates will be made server-side. This is to give you a
    chance to review or remove any lines that would cause overwrites before committing them.
-   Category icons must use the file extension .png to allow transparency
-   The program will not catch duplicate IDs within the dataset being written, e.g. if a file
    contains more than 1 category with a CategoryId of 1, the furthest down the file will overwrite
    the data for those that appeared before it.
-   The JSON file handling is more robust than the CSV and should be used if commas exist within
    CSV cells.



STEPS TO SETUP

1) Copy the google-services.json from MobileApplication to the "app" folder in this project


2) From the left-hand menu of the console of your Firebase account, go to "Database" and enable
"Cloud Firestore".
From the "Cloud Firestore" page, open the "RULES" tab and replace the text there with:

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}

then click "PUBLISH".


3) From the left-hand menu of the console of your Firebase account, go to "Storage" and add a folder
called "icons".

**Note this next step will break the game application if it has not yet been updated for the new
infrastructure. You can leave the existing rules and simply add the new one (the 3 lines in the
middle of the text block below) to keep the older app version functioning.**

Open the "RULES" tab and replace the text there with:

service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /icons/{fileName} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && fileName.matches('.*\\.png');
    }
    match /offers/offers.txt {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}

then click "PUBLISH".


4) Adding data

Copy-paste JSON into the JSON files provided in the "assets" folder, OR,
copy-paste CSV file contents into the CSV files provided in the "assets" folder (When you run the
app, set the input file type accordingly).

Then add category icons, each named "icon.png" to a subfolder in the "assets" folder, where each
subfolder is named "catX" (no quotes) where X is the CategoryId of the icon's category, e.g. "cat1".

For the existing data entities (topics, questions, and answers), I kept the same format that has
been used to date in the CSV/JSON files, and used similar formats for the added entities.
The expected JSON keys/column headings (these can be changed in the code) for each file are as
follows:

answers.json
    "AnswerId"      integer, a unique identifier within the topic the answer belongs to
    "TopicId"       integer, the "TopicId" of the answer's topic
